Presentations repo containing folders for all presentations, including various versions of the same presentation given at different Meetups, SQL Saturdays and other conferences.  
The folder "Tame Your Workday with Modern SQL Server Features" is the presentation previously entitled, "Modern SQL Server Features that make life better." This is a presentation 
designed to introduce features in modern SQL Server. The information is NOT an in-depth review of any one particular feature. The introduction will allow attendees to familiarize themselves with a wide range of features in modern, supported versions of SQL Server, 
with the goal being to enable technologists to further explore those features in their own environment and deploy these features as they make sense.
